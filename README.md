We use state machines all the time in our applications, sometimes without even knowing it. Most applications have discrete, legal states and a well-defined set of actions that may cause legal state transitions. We will explore how to use the Elm architeture and Elm union types to build state machines in our applications. We will use a number of examples including managing network operations, handling mouse events and performing lexial parsing of text. In each case these examples will show how to leverag the Elm architecture and type system to produce reliable, maintainable applicatiions without invalid states.
